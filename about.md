## Bio

I was born in Vancouver in 1991, and grew up between Tokyo and Sydney.
Though I loved reading and learning, I didn't care much for school, and spent my early years heavily gaming in MMOs,
probably being among the first few to really make a living playing video games.

As I hit my late teens, my gaming turned into a career as a professional poker player.
During that time, I travelled extensively throughout South America and Europe; I was an early digital nomad.
Three years in, the ethics of gambling became troubling to me, so I quit. I then went to college at
Princeton, where I picked up a degree in math (much to my own surprise). People kept telling me I'd
make a good academic, so I did one final lap of school at Cambridge in economics.

After I finally determined that academia wasn't for me, I moved to Silicon Valley in late 2015, where I've been active
as an entrepreneur and investor in early-stage companies.
