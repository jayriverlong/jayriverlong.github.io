I would stay up all night competitively playing video games, and then head to school on two or three hours of sleep. If I tried to attend class, I would immediately pass out on my desk. There was a coffee machine in the cafeteria, where I would solve that problem by purchasing a cup of scalding-hot black coffee for fifty cents. It was shitty coffee, and I hated the flavor. But I needed it, and took the bitterness as fair punishment for not sleeping. That cup got me wired – the caffeine rush would electrify my body, and my hand would shake erratic, two-inch tall letters out of my Pilot V5.</p> <p>Two hours later, I’d get another cup, and that would last me into the early afternoon. I’d crash and fall asleep in class at 1:50pm, like clockwork. I’d get another cup at 2:00pm between classes, to carry me through the rest of the day. When I took my finals before graduating, the principal sent out a grade-wide complaint that too many coffee cups got littered outside the exam rooms. They were all mine. My #1 concern in high school was dying of a heart attack due to my completely insane sleep and caffeine habits.</p> <p>Somehow I survived high school. My sleep patterns would, over the course of the years, very slowly approach those of a normal person, but coffee stuck. I would drink it to help stay up late, or to wake me up after a short night. When things got really urgent I’d supplement with some Red Bull. My tastes advanced a little bit: I quit the punitive straight black coffee, and experimented with extravagances like sugar and milk. As I started to work internships near Starbuckses, I would get vanilla-hazelnut lattes, and my coffee runs were known for their consistency and punctuality.</p> <p>After college and graduate school, things kicked up a notch. Lots of people define their persona by their love of coffee, and I chose to be one of those. I drank coffee – lattes, in particular – religiously. My first business card’s title read <em>Caffeine Fiend</em>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> I systematically sampled nearly every single cafe in San Francisco. Weirdly, I knew I didn’t really love lattes. I liked them, but a latte can ultimately only be so good. They were a habit, something I’d been doing for a long time, and had made part of my persona.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> Besides, I needed the kick. I realized that coffee was useful in technical, creative work not because it increases wakefulness, but because it increases <em>focus</em>. I had a latte machine in the office and a company to build, so at some point I hit ten cups a day.</p> <p>Enter March 2020. I had moved offices – no more free coffee – and was spending more on cinnamon lattes than some people spend on their mortgage. I was more cautious than most about COVID-19, and started isolating myself in early March. Being a coffee addict but not a true aficionado, I did not own anything in the way of a coffee machine. (I have never made much use of my kitchen.) I had no way to make coffee at home, and due to COVID I wasn’t in the mood to go out shopping. Almost four months later, I still haven’t had any coffee.</p> <p>Losing coffee was unpleasant at first. Abandoning a ritual can make the rest of the day feel weirdly incomplete. But I soon stopped missing or thinking about it. My quality of life had improved. With coffee, the regular motions of the day become exaggerated – there would be spikes of focus and the feeling of productivity<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>, but there would also be caffeine crashes every four hours. The days that I used caffeine to push myself too far would invariably end in long headaches. I often felt very seriously drained at the end of the workday, and couldn’t do anything in the evening.</p> <p>The last four months, without coffee, have been much better. No headaches. No crashes. Consequently – and ironically – I’m now probably <em>more awake</em> on average throughout the day. I’ve been very surprised by how little I actually needed the caffeine, even in the morning after a short night. Thus, I’m not sure how much value caffeine actually provided me over the past few working years. I had so much of it that the beneficial effects certainly wore off (I would even drink coffee right before going to sleep). However, the downsides of coffee – trading in later energy to have more focus now, the drain and crash later in the day – never wore off.</p> <p>Ultimately, as COVID wraps up and things go back to normal, I don’t feel the need to pick up coffee again. Maybe I’ll try decaf for the pleasure of an evening latte, but I’m happy to kick the habit.</p> <p><br /></p> <hr /> <div class="footnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1"> <p>Cringe, I know. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:2"> <p>For me, this triggered careful introspection about whether I really derived pleasure from the things I claimed to like, or whether those claims were really just signaling about the person I would like to be, rather than who I actually am. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:3"> <p>The jury is still out on how much more productive I <em>actually</em> was, if at all. I wonder if there’s some counter-intuitive effect by which access to coffee encourages worse sleep (because you can stay up late and then just drink coffee when you’re tired) which leaves you less productive overall. <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p> </li> </ol> </div> <br> </article> </main> <footer class="footer" role="contentinfo"> <small> <a href='https://twitter.com/jayriverlong'>twitter.com/jayriverlong</a> <br/> <a href='https://jayriverlong.substack.com/'>jayriverlong.substack.com</a> </small> </footer> </body> </html>
