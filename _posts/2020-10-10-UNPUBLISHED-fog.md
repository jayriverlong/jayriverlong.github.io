title: A Time of Great Uncertainty
date:   2020-10-10
summary: Will things return to normal? No. What is the new normal? I'm not sure.

Whenever people experience trauma, their first question is when things
will go back to normal. But things never quite go back to normal,
because the trauma is part of their memories and actions from then on.
Instead of things going back to normal, the new state
is *the new normal*.


COVID-19 has been a traumatizing time for many: lockdowns, loneliness, death.
We thought things would be "back to normal" in the summer: they are not,
and it has taken so long already that it's both hard to actively remember
the "normal" life pre-COVID, and hard to imagine the miracle that would turn things
back to normal in the coming months. The longer COVID carries on, the more it
becomes clear that *this is the new normal*.


So this is the new normal. But what is this state of existence? It is
rife with uncertainty and deep, existential questions, in ways that are
-- for Americans -- new, not encountered arguably since the cold war:

- Should I be worried about Coronavirus?

    I suspect these topics get attention for two reasons:
    **(a)** They add an air of intellectual legitimacy to venture investing.
        Like technical analysis for stocks, it adds pseudo-rigor,
        making the process of investing look more scientific.
        Sometimes these patterns are truthfully there, but they are usually
        only apparent in retrospect.
