summary: As I become older, I find it harder not to give in to my emotions.

My parents are smart, well-educated people.
But as they hit their fifties and sixties,
they started having fearful views on flying.
They're both still frequent flyers
and not afraid of flying *per se*,
but they became very particular about which airlines and planes are "safe" and which aren't.
When the Boeing 737 Max safety debacle happened, they were drumming about it for
weeks -- talking about never flying Boeing again -- even though boarding the 737 Max was still
obviously statistically safer than driving, or crossing the street.
They understood the stats, but somehow emotion had them gripped tight.[^2]


I found it strange to see my parents become irrationally afraid over the years.
But as I've become older, I've begun to see hints of the same in me.


Two years ago, I became afraid of heights. I'm not sure why. It happened almost overnight.
Before, I could walk over bridges with thin railings and steep drops, sit on
chairlifts of absurd heights, and dance on forty-storieth balconies.
These days, the same scenarios put me in an anxious panic.
That feels very weird: for most of my life, I've been in control
of my emotions, generally unafraid of anything.
And all of a sudden, mid-way through being 28, deep anxiety over heights
starts dictating how I live my life.


More recently, I've been thinking about going vegetarian.
My position on meat has always been
that animals carry zero moral value, i.e. eating chicken isn't
different from eating beans.
But the idea of eating
animals is becoming more and more *gross* to me.
My moral position is unchanged, but
almost inexplicably, it's the idea of the animal itself -- an alien but familiar lifeform,
living, breathing, getting slaughtered, and so on -- that is becoming uncomfortable to me.
The more it's on my mind, the more of a visceral repulsion I feel. Rational? No.


Overall, it feels like my rationality of thought is very slowly being replaced
by emotional compulsion.
I have a hunch this is symptomatic of information overload, as if
my thinking is becoming unclear, polluted with *too much stuff*.


As a child and young adult, I navigated reasonably simple universes
of information.
I was highly rational (probably unusually so), and extremely consequent in how I made my decisions --
I didn't really think about anything other than what I was trying to optimize.
Inadvertently, I cut through the noise.


Today, the noise is too thick to cut through. I'm sitting on the emotional accumulation of decades of life,
a mass of experiences and information cluttering my mind.
I'm distracted all the time by notions of second-order effects, what-if edge cases,
and social virtue signals.
I suspect that when there's such a morass of information that it becomes difficult
to navigate, emotions take over as a shortcut to analysis.



Successful thinking is clear thinking, and
clear thinking is *simple*.[^1]
That requires structuring a huge mess of thoughts, and cutting through them
cleanly to get to the core.
The huge mess of thoughts only becomes larger as we become older,
and more inundated with information online.
Somewhat ironically, the more information you ingest, the harder you have to work
to maintain clarity of thought.

[^1]: There's been a recent scandal in the press about Peter Thiel having $5B in his Roth IRA.
    It's a perfect and funny example of successful, clear, and simple thinking --
    putting startup stock in a self-directed Roth
    is very easy and extremely valuable to do, but very few founders do it.
    I suppose it is just an "unusual" thing to do -- power to those who cut through the noise
    and go for it.

[^2]: What's interesting is that they seem afraid not so much for their own lives
    as for the lives of their adult children. My parents are happy to fly together.
    But if my siblings and I are on the same plane, my parents will be very upset.
    "What if the plane crashes? Then it's all for nothing!" In their minds,
    losing
    their children at this stage in life is a fate worse than death.
    I suspect that having children
    has such an evolutionarily powerful cognitive effect on how we view and prioritize *risk*
    that it is a big part of aging into irrationality.
