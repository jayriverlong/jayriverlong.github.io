<p>I never identified as a coffee snob or someone with a serious habit –
like everyone else, I made lots of self-deprecating jokes about how much coffee I drank –
until one day I realized that I had been drinking more coffee than anyone else I knew for the past fifteen years.</p>

<p>I started drinking coffee in high school. I would stay up all night competitively playing video games,
and then head to school on two or three hours of sleep. If I tried to attend class,
I would immediately pass out on my desk. There was a coffee machine in the cafeteria,
where I would solve that problem by purchasing a cup of scalding-hot black coffee for fifty cents.
It was shitty coffee, and I hated the flavor. But I needed it, and took the bitterness as
fair punishment for not sleeping.
That cup got me
wired – the caffeine rush would electrify my body, and
my hand would shake erratic, two-inch tall letters out of my Pilot V5.</p>

<p>Two hours later, I’d get another cup, and that would last me into the early afternoon.
I’d crash and fall asleep in class at 1:50pm, like clockwork. I’d get another cup at 2:00pm
between classes, to carry me through the rest of the day.
When I took my finals before graduating, the principal sent out a grade-wide
complaint that too many coffee cups got littered outside the exam rooms. They were all mine.
My #1 concern in high school was
dying of a heart attack due to my completely insane sleep and caffeine habits.</p>

<p>Somehow I survived high school. My sleep patterns would,
over the course of the years, very slowly approach those of a normal person,
but coffee stuck. I would drink it to help stay up late, or to wake me up
after a short night. When things got really urgent I’d supplement with some Red Bull.
My tastes advanced a little bit: I quit the punitive straight black coffee,
and experimented with extravagances like sugar and milk. As I started to work
internships near Starbuckses, I would get vanilla-hazelnut lattes, and my
coffee runs were known for their consistency and punctuality.</p>

<p>After college and graduate school, things kicked up a notch. Lots of people
define their persona by their love of coffee, and I chose to be one of those.
I drank coffee – lattes, in particular – religiously. My first business card’s title read <em>Caffeine Fiend</em>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>
I systematically sampled nearly every single cafe in San Francisco.
Weirdly, I knew I didn’t really love lattes. I liked them, but a latte can ultimately only be so good.
They were a habit, something I’d been doing for a long time, and had made
part of my persona.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> Besides, I needed the kick. I realized that coffee
was useful in technical, creative work not because it increases wakefulness,
but because it increases <em>focus</em>. I had a latte machine in the office and a company to build,
so at some point I hit ten cups a day.</p>

<p>Enter March 2020. I had moved offices – no more free coffee – and was
spending more on cinnamon lattes than some people spend on their mortgage.
I was more cautious than most about COVID-19, and started isolating myself
in early March. Being a coffee addict but not a true aficionado, I did not own
anything in the way of a coffee machine. (I have never made much use of my kitchen.)
I had no way to make coffee at home,
and due to COVID I wasn’t in the mood to go out shopping. Almost four months later,
I still haven’t had any coffee.</p>

<p>Losing coffee was unpleasant at first.
Abandoning a ritual can make the rest of the day feel weirdly incomplete.
But I soon stopped missing or thinking about it.
My quality of life had improved.
With coffee, the regular motions of the day become exaggerated – there would be spikes of focus
and the feeling of productivity<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>,
but there would also be caffeine crashes every four hours.
The days that I used caffeine to push myself too far would invariably end in long headaches.
I often felt very seriously drained at the end of the workday, and couldn’t do anything in the evening.</p>

<p>The last four months, without coffee, have been much better.
No headaches. No crashes.
Consequently – and ironically – I’m now probably <em>more awake</em> on average throughout the day.
I’ve been very surprised by how little I actually needed the caffeine, even in the morning after a short night.
Thus, I’m not sure how much value caffeine actually provided me over the past few working
years. I had so much of it that the beneficial effects certainly wore off (I would
even drink coffee right before going to sleep). However, the downsides of
coffee – trading in later energy to have more focus now, the drain and crash later in the day –
never wore off.</p>

<p>Ultimately, as COVID wraps up and things go back to normal,
I don’t feel the need
to pick up coffee again. Maybe I’ll try decaf for the
pleasure of an evening latte, but I’m happy to kick the habit.</p>

      <p>For me, this triggered careful introspection about whether I
really derived pleasure from the things I claimed to like, or whether those
claims were really just signaling about the person I would like to be, rather than who I actually am. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>The jury is still out on how much more productive I <em>actually</em> was, if at all. I wonder if there’s
some counter-intuitive effect by which access to coffee encourages worse sleep
(because you can stay up late and then just drink coffee when you’re tired)
which leaves you less productive overall. <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
