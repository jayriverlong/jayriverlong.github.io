<p>It has long been said that the internet has a power to remove
middlemen, to make opportunity more accessible, and to lower barriers to entry.
Throughout Spring/Summer 2020, we’ve seen this promise rapidly become true, at scale,
in a number of industries.
These markets have eliminated middlemen both as
gatekeepers (hurdles to access) and as distributors (aggregators of supply and demand).
As such, these markets have emerged peer-to-peer structures, greatly increasing their <em>resolution</em>.
Let’s look at these dynamics in a few examples:</p>

<p><strong>Rolling Funds</strong>: productized by AngelList, they’ve enabled
    faster, more granular raising of venture capital funds.
    They’re perfect for reputable angel investors
    to raise external funds from smaller LPs. <a href="https://twitter.com/shl/status/1291760138571849728">Sahil Lavingia</a>
    and <a href="https://medium.com/@CindyBiSV/capitalx-is-live-rolling-fund-3d7ccfe9736a">Cindy Bi</a>
    are leading examples. Fundraising, especially as a first-time fund manager,
    used to take hundreds of meetings with HNWIs and funds-of-funds. Now, someone with a strong online following
    can raise hundreds of small cheques from people they have never even spoken with.</p>

<p>The corollary is an increase in the resolution of the market.
Suddenly, the set of entities you can raise from, or who are able
to invest in these markets, is no longer a pool of professional capital allocators,
but <em>nearly anyone</em>.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">1</a></sup> The minimum cheque size changes too, and the micro-LP emerges.
In the past, a multi-millionaire might write a $250K cheque to
Kleiner Perkins. Now, a tech worker might write twenty-five $10k cheques to smart solo GPs.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Substack</strong>: not only are new writers like <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-02/nathan-tankus-s-newsletter-subscribers-don-t-care-about-diplomas">Nathan Tankus</a>
     making a name for themselves (and a full-time income)
    on the newsletter subscription site, it’s also
    attracting well-established journalists like Alison Roman, Alex Kantrowitz,
    Anne Helen Petersen, and more.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">3</a></sup>
    With a couple thousand subscribers each at $5 a month,
    they’re probably making more than they were at their traditional
    institutions.</p>

<p>The (editorial) gatekeeper has disappeared, and the unbundling again
increases the resolution of the market: instead of reading a journal’s opinion columns,
I might just subscribe to a number of newsletters and curate my own columns.
Instead of the author being paid by the journal,
which might not be entirely aligned with the author’s views, the author is paid directly
by their readers. In terms of authenticity, this peer-to-peer model is superior.</p>

<p><strong>OnlyFans</strong>: People had been talking about
    “Patreon, but for porn” for years; here it is at last.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">4</a></sup>
    This is yet another way for people to capitalize on their
    online popularity, connect peer-to-peer with their audience, and cut out
    traditional gatekeepers<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup> and distributors. What’s particularly
    interesting about
    OnlyFans is that it is <em>obviously superior</em> to the traditional
    distribution model: old-school porn studios used to sell videos by the view.
    As pornstars of the 2010s pioneered with private Snapchats, it turned out
    that community and (the illusions of) exclusivity and attention
    are real drivers of engagement, and, in turn, revenue. Having a presence
    on OnlyFans is massively more lucrative than being a traditional pornstar.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>SPACs</strong>: there’s been a surge in <em><a href="https://alexdanco.com/2020/07/24/spac-man-begins/">Special Purpose Acquisition Companies</a></em>,
    which are effectively massive blank cheques ($100M+) to highly reputable investors,
    for them to use to take private companies public. Like
    rolling funds, these are primarily vehicles betting on the reputations of
    their champions.</p>

<p>Of course, these trends are not entirely novel.
For example, Patreon and Bandcamp are spiritual precursors to Substack and OnlyFans.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote">7</a></sup>
But the pace has picked up, and in a COVID world,
tech accelerates and we’ll  see more of these
enterprises soon. For example,
homeschooling, whether by choice or not, is
rapidly becoming more common.
I expect that someone will  <em>completely remake</em>
online tutoring, and teachers will move from the classroom to giving 1:1 online lessons.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">8</a></sup>
In this environment, top-performing teachers will finally be paid fairly.
Similar trends are already emerging for fitness coaches and therapists.</p>

<p>What’s remarkable about these trends is that they’re taking place <em>now</em> and not earlier.
In terms of pure technology or regulation, any of these companies could have been started
ten or twenty years ago. Why did it take until 2020 for simple
innovations – paid individual subscriptions, monetizing reputation –
to take off? I cannot imagine any answer other than that the internet has
finally hit a certain maturity in that it is possible for people to achieve
real reputation at scale <em>without</em> the gimmick of going viral. The online
self-published media that we have – Twitter, Medium, YouTube, etc. and all their deeply imperfect
discovery algorithms – is a mess, but it seems to be successfully giving a voice
to creators <em>and</em> enabling reasonably effective discovery/distribution of content.
Platforms to capitalize on reputations are developing as quickly as it is
actually possible to develop monetizable reputations at scale.</p>

<p>The middlemen of old were gatekeepers and aggregators: content creators would apply to middlemen,
who would in turn distribute the content to an established
base of consumers. The middleman both aggregated supply and demand in the market.
The matching of the two sides of the market was coarse at best.
The technology we have now – what Twitter, Twitch, etc. ultimately represent –
are opaque interest matching engines
that enable sufficient distribution and discovery of content,
such that the supply and demand sides can actually be matched on a peer-to-peer basis at scale.
This is remarkable.</p>

      <p>Consequently, I wouldn’t be surprised if we start seeing even more angels
who play in Pre-Seed/Seed/Series A, and more party rounds that boot out the
traditional venture firms. I don’t think this would actually have an effect
on round pricing, but it would – very importantly – usually delay the
addition of the first investor board member to the Series A or B. <a href="#fnref:4" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>I’m baffled that no-one else had built OnlyFans previously.
It seemed the only real hurdle was compliance and getting onboarded
with payment providers. Now, someone out there is building a bootstrapped,
soon-to-be billion-dollar business, because they were willing to go through
compliance slog that no-one else could be bothered doing. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>You’d be shocked by how <a href="https://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/sex/news/a43706/porn-salaries/">little money</a>
even the most popular traditional
pornstars make. Being on OnlyFans, or even on a regular camsite, with a
couple hundred followers, is easily a better deal (while also being much safer for the star).
Mia Khalifa – briefly one of the biggest names in porn –
made <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/08/12/mia-khalifa-claims-she-made-only-12k-doing-porn/">less than $12k</a>

Porn is a somewhat neglected industry that has been decimated by online piracy,
and doesn’t have a powerful institution like the RIAA to defend it. <a href="#fnref:6" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>If you’re willing to stretch the definition a little, you could argue
that Instagram influencer advertising – where a brand works directly with
the influencer – disintermediates the traditional advertising agency model.
In the context of our discussion, it’s also another good example of
building and capitalizing on reputation in one stroke. <a href="#fnref:8" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
