<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Dobrik">David Dobrik</a>,
a YouTube star with 26 million followers, is launching a social media app
called <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dispo-live-in-the-moment/id1491684197">Dispo</a>.
There’s a good chance it turns him into a billionaire.</p>

<p>Dobrik is wealthy already. His monthly YouTube check is around
<a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a29798708/david-dobrik-salary/">$275k</a>,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>
and he probably makes a little more from his merchandise sales.
After a seven-year career becoming one of the most famous YouTubers, he’s probably
worth around $30 million. However, if he succeeds with Dispo, his earnings-to-date would
pale in comparison.</p>

<p>Dispo is a compelling product, and there’s a good chance it will be very successful, for two reasons.
First, Dobrik is outrageously popular with an everyman appeal and a
loyal following in a highly valuable
demographic.
Second, Dobrik’s reach is <em>enormous</em>. By himself, he has 26 million
subscribers on YouTube, 23 million on TikTok, and 14 million on Instagram.
The rest of his entourage have millions more. Dobrik himself
has accumulated 8.5 <em>billion</em> YouTube views.</p>

<p>With only light marketing, Dobrik has gotten a million downloads for Dispo already.
If he starts seriously pushing Dispo,
he will easily get millions more.
Normally, the biggest hurdle for consumer software/social media apps is solving
the initial chicken-and-egg problem: how do you get people to sign up if no-one else
is on it? Dobrik bulldozes this problem. He is a one-man network effect.
While other companies spend
years slowly growing by word-of-mouth and spending millions of dollars on marketing,
Dobrik eclipses them from day one: he
gets his first million users by just telling his followers to download his cool new app.
While traditional brands
might balk at forking over tens of millions of dollars in cash
to influencer advertising campaigns of hard-to-assess effectiveness,
for Dobrik, this is free.</p>

<p>It’s hard to overstate how important this is. Lots of great products die because
they can’t get early-stage consumer traction, sometimes for no reason other than bad luck.
Dobrik can catapult a product
into the growth stage. He creates what normally takes <em>years</em> of brand development instantly with zero cost.
Normally, an early-stage consumer product
in a highly competitive space like social media will pay about $10-30 in customer
acquisition costs (CAC) to register a single new user.
Dobrik’s following gifts him
the equivalent of tens of millions of dollars in CAC.</p>

<p>Consumer software presents an elegant solution to an age-old problem: influencers
(more traditionally, celebrities) have millions of people watching their every move, but often struggle to
monetize all these eyeballs, even though attention is arguably the most valuable
scarce resource in our internet economy.
Historically, these people have sold
merchandise, been paid for appearances, done book deals, acted in movies/TV, endorsed products,
and sometimes even put out music albums.
These things all make money, but
relative to the value of their brand and the attention it gets,
these monetization techniques are earning pennies on the dollar. These are
five- and six-figure deals when their full CAC potential is worth hundreds of millions.</p>

<p>If Dobrik succeeds, it will change the influencer monetization game.
While top-tier
influencers previously made single-digit millions of dollars, commercial success
for Dispo could be worth hundreds of millions, if not more.
If Dispo just raises a Series A or Series B, Dobrik’s share in Dispo (at least on paper) would
be more valuable than his current net worth.</p>

<p>Regardless if Dobrik succeeds in this way, some influencer
will, sooner or later.
Consumer tech has been moving
steadily from San Francisco to Los Angeles over the past few years – virtually
all the cool new consumer companies are out of LA – and it’s only a matter of time
until the tech and influencer worlds intertwine more in this way.
For a start, TikTok influencers
at the Sway House are starting
to <a href="https://www.ibtimes.com/tiktok-influencers-sway-boys-turn-angel-investors-just-trying-make-smart-investments-3051715">angel invest</a>
into consumer social companies, and use their followings to help grow those businesses.</p>

<p>This intertwining seems inevitable. The entrepreneurial spirit is already there.
Emma Chamberlain (10 million YouTube followers) started a <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/09/10042481/emma-chamberlain-coffee-merch-brand-interview">coffee company</a>.
Bryce Hall and Josh Richards (combined 36 million TikTok Followers) started
an <a href="https://dankanator.com/74391/josh-richards-bryce-hall-launching-ani-energy-drink/">energy drink company</a>.
The only issue is that
merch or beverage companies have low upside and command low multiples, compared to software.
By opportunity cost, it’s not the best use of these influencers’ brands.
It’s only a matter of time until they start co-founding businesses in the
high multiple, high-upside consumer software space.
In the past, consumer tech made influencers. Soon, influencers will make consumer tech.</p>
