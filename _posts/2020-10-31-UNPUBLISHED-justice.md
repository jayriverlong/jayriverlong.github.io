summary:
    Cancel culture is so controversial because it is online social justice
    with no common standard. How do we settle on norms and process?

Recent years have been filled with discussions of cancel culture,
social justice, and identity politics.
These have risen with the internet and the *voice* that it grants:
everyone can participate, but everyone's
entire history of opinion is also publicly available.


This double-edged sword has entirely predictable consequences:
it becomes
possible to speak out over bad actors who would otherwise have slipped through the cracks,
but people's insensitive teenage jokes -- or even acceptable statements at the time --
get them crucified ten years later.
This is a difficult situation, because
the process of seeking public justice has both clear positives and clear negatives,
while being high-variance and often erring in either direction.


As a standard of justice, this is obviously poor.
*Even if it is just more often than not*,
it seems to cause damage too capriciously (in either harming the innocent or
creating punishment far beyond what the misdeed merits) too often to call the process,
or its consequences, *justice*.
In turn, the random capriciousness of this has a chilling effect
on free speech in general, and thereby hurts people it is meant to protect:
those who are trying to share opinions in good faith.


Online social justice is effectively vigilante justice.
Vigilante justice is
outlawed in the real world because it is too capricious as a standard.
In the real world, we have a body of law, assembled carefully over hundreds of years,
to deal with disputes. Online, we don't have any such body of law at all,
so we can't blame people for being vigilantes -- somebody has to step up,
and by and large, I assume good intentions on their part.


However, we clearly need a set of common standards
on how to (1) judge people's behavior online and (2) dispense justice online.
Current debates on whether cancel culture is good or not generally misses
the fact that there will *always* be some social justice online. For that reason,
we need standards.


I am not suggesting a single common standard, obviously that level of consensus is impossible.
It would be be fine if there were two, or ten, or a hundred.
Right now there are no standards.
There is only a deluge of comments from people
ranging from well-meaning citizens to paid provocateurs.
What we need is *any set of standards at all*.


You might have standards at the community level.
In the early days of the internet, bulletin board-style forums
generally had quite strict codes of conduct, and loyal volunteer moderators to
enforce them.
History thus reminds us that our vendors get to set the terms of participation,
or deliberately choose not to set them.
The biggest shops -- Twitter and Facebook -- have been more in the latter camp.
At their scale, they are no longer private discussion forums, but more like
public utilities -- they have little incentive to ideologically confront their users,
or to prejudice revenue and public opinion by policing too hard.


You might also have standards chosen at the individual level, perhaps like how creators
choose Creative Commons licenses for their websites.
Debates about online wrongdoers might then be less about the person
and the case's particularities, but more about which standard is more fair.
This deprives arguments of the oxygen required to really flame up:
in our current world, any rebuttal in an online debate is an engagement,
and you'll go back-and-forth for a while.
For example, if someone is accused of having said
something bad twenty years ago, and you respond that you don't care about statements from twenty years ago,
the response inevitably will be "but this was *really* bad, surely you don't condone this"
and you're in it.
If your response were simply "I don't agree, I subscribe to the Powell standard",
and that's a commonly accepted online community standard wherein people aren't
judged for any statements they made more than five years ago,
then that's a whole different (and much less incindiery)
starting point.


Either way, the presence of *any* standards will immediately have some positive effects:

1. Some standards will be more commonly accepted than others, and credibility will
    naturally emerge. There's a network effect/feedback loop to credibility, so
    just the very presence of those standards will hopefully nudge people
    to the more reasonable ones over time.

2. Choosing standards forces individuals to think somewhat rigorously and disciplinedly,
    both when they choose a standard and when they apply it in practice.[^1]

3. Standards deflate the heat in many social-justice style arguments,
    because the discussions
    become about inert, abstract, *standards*, not people.
    Personal debates cause villainization of your opponents and
    polarization -- making them less
    personal is a very good thing.


3. It gives people shields to hide behind in good-faith discussion.
    The ability to refer to common standards makes it much easier to explain
    your own position as a matter of *policy*, and it makes it easier to figure out
    what's defensible to say in the first place.

4.  People's views will change not one-by-one, but in bulk.
    Online discussion is only rarely effective in changing people's minds.
    But if the discussions someone opens are perpetually shut down because
    people think their standard is laughable, then they'll reconsider their
    choice of standard and pick something more agreeable -- however,
    that implies not just changing one small position, but a whole host of them, at once.

    Eric Weinstein calls the Hilbert Problems of social justice: the inherent contradictions
    in rehabilitation vs. cancellation, womens' rights vs. religious freedom of expression,
    and so on.
